What's new in version 2.0
-------------------------

*) Extended syntax to allow options to be passed multiple times (the
   value is then stored in a bash array).
*) Numeric options whose default value is NONE (i.e. unset numeric
   values) are now truly unset, and the empty string is thus no longer
   accepted in the command line for those options).
   Note: this slightly breaks backwards-compatibility (thus the version bump).
*) Added bash completion facility for any script which uses bash_optparse.
*) Added utility for template generation

What's new in version 1.1
-------------------------

*) Fully customizable exit error codes:
   +) via environment variables for errors in bash_optparse
      invocation (installation problems, script parsing failed)
   +) via SETTINGS for errors produced by bash_optparse at runtime
*) Enhanced flags:
   +) revertible default values
   +) allow alternate flags which revert the effect
*) New setting allows long options with a single dash
*) Added utility to inspect generated script

Version 1.0 features
--------------------

*) Easy-to-maintain, easy-to-read syntax (similar to python's optparse)
*) Option definitions:
   +) Each option has a bash varaible name associated to it
   +) type-checking: options can have arguments of type STRING, INT,
      FLOAT, or not have arguments (i.e. flags). Type check is
      performed at run-time
   +) range-checking: option arguments can have ranges (STRING
      can be subject to regexp's, INt and FLOAT can have min, max and
      step values)
   +) default-values: all options can have a default value
   +) short-options: are normally auto-generated from long version, but
      everything is customizable
*) Arguments definitions:
   +) Can give name to arguments, and set them as mandatory or optional;
   +) Strict check of arguments number (except if otherwise specified).
*) Auto-generation of nicely-formatted help message
*) Sensible error messages:
   +) When parsing the configuration script
   +) When parsing the command line
*) Customizable through settings
*) Normally works by generating a bash script on the fly; however, the
   generated script is made to be human-readable and readily modifiable
*) Can be used within functions [experimental feature]
