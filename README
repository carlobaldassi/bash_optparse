BASH OPTPARSE
an advanced command line
parsing system for Bash
========================

This program brings into bash a method for parsing the
command line which is somehow similar in spirit to python's
optparse, or boost::program_options or others, i.e. it
provides a framework in which the program options and
arguments are described in a compact format and passed to
bash_optparse, which in turn produces a portion of bash
script which performs the parsing, sets default values,
implements dynamic checks for type and range of the
variables, auto-generates a nicely formatted usage()
function etc.

The typical usage in a script could be something like this:

. bash_optparse << EOF
OPTIONS_BEGIN
  perc FLOAT x [0:100] 50 "Select percentage"
OPTIONS_END

ARGUMENTS_BEGIN
  infile False "input file"
ARGUMENTS_END
EOF

The OPTION line in the example describes a long option named
--perc, associated to a varaible of the same name, of type
FLOAT, whose range is between 0 and 100, and which defaults
to 50. A short option -p is also automatically added as an
alias to the long option. The corresponding help line in the
auto-generated usage output would be:

  -p, --perc <x>  Select percentage (<x>=float in [0.0:100.0],
                  default=50)

The ARGUMENT line describes how to pass an optional argument,
which will be stored in the variable $infile.

See `example_script_simple' and `example_script' in the `doc'
directory for more information. The explanation of the
syntax can be found in the comments to the example_script code.
