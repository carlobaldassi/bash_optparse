BASH OPTPARSE
an advanced command line
parsing system for Bash
========================

This program brings into bash a method for parsing the
command line which is somehow similar in spirit to python's
optparse, or boost::program_options or others, i.e. it
provides a framework in which the program options and
arguments are described in a compact format and passed to
bash_optparse, which in turn produces a portion of bash
script which performs the parsing, sets default values,
implements dynamic checks for type and range of the
variables, auto-generates a nicely formatted usage()
function etc.

The typical usage in a script could be something like this:

. bash_optparse << EOF
OPTION, perc, FLOAT, p, [0:100], 50, "Select percentage"
ARGUMENT, infile, False, "input file"
EOF

The OPTION line in the example describes an option named
--perc, associated to a varaible of the same name, of type
FLOAT, whose range is between 0 and 100, and which defaults
to 50. The corresponding help line in the usage output would
be:

  --perc <p>  Select percentage (<p>=float in [0.0:100.0],
              default=50.0)

The ARGUMENT line describes how to pass an optional argument,
which will be stored in the variable $infile.

See the example script and the detailed syntax description
in the doc directory for more information.
