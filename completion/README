Bash optparse completion rules
==============================

The file 'bash_optparse_completion' adds option autocompletion
functionality to bash for any script which makes use of bash_optparse.

This functionality is not activated by default when installing bash_optparse;
to test it, just source the file with a command like:

  source bash_optparse_completion

To use it by default, copy the file in a system-level directory of
bash completion scripts (e.g. /etc/bash_completion.d).

Additional Notes
----------------

1) Performance is currently rather slow, especially for scripts with many
   options.

2) It currently works only with scripts, not functions

3) Recognition of bash_optparse usage is heuristic; it may fail if you
   use aliases, bash variables within the script, advanced constructs etc.
   In case of doubts, stick to the example files in the `doc' directory.

4) The script works by adding a default completion to bash via the
   'complete -D' command, and using a fallback to default behaviour in case
   bash_optparse usage is not detected. This should work fine most of the time;
   however, if you did already override the default bash completion behaviour
   with some other 'complete -D' command, it will either be overridden or it
   will override the bash_optparse one, depending on which is called last.
