Bash optparse documentation
===========================

The documentation for bash_optparse is provided via three
example files:

  1) example_script_simple : this is provided as a kickoff
     example and a quick reference

  2) example_script : this is a full-featured and heavily
     commented example. The full syntax of bash_optparse is
     demonstrated here and explained in the comments
     therein.

  3) example_function : this shows how to adjust bash_optparse
     invocation when it is used within functions.
