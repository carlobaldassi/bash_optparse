SCRIPT_VERSION="0.1"

# In order to use bash_optparse, we source it (calling it like ". bash_optparse") and
# we provide the command line description of options and arguments as a here-document
# (using the "<<" operator).
# In this way, the code is generated dynamically and the script is easily maintainable.
#
# Furthermore, we can use bash variables (such as $SCRIPT_VERSION in this example).
#
# Note that bash-style line comments are allowed within bash_optparse: after an unquoted
# and unescaped '#', everything on the line is ignored.
#
# Try the following command lines:
#   ./example_script --help
#   ./example_script --version
#   ./example_script a b c d e f g
#   ./example_script --string-option-1=two --go a
#   ./example_script --go --dont-go a
#
# The above command lines should succeed, the following instead should fail:
#   ./example_script
#   ./example_script --string-option-1=four a
#   ./example_script --int-option-3=2 a
#
# Note: bash_optparse itself may fail. There are two possible reasons for this:
#   *) Some essential program or file is missing on the system (indicating some problem with
#      installation of bash_optparse);
#   *) The script passed to bash_optparse contains errors.
# In both cases, bash_optparse outputs a message and exits. The default exit code is 10. You
# may change this value by setting some environment variables, like this:
#   export BASH_OPTPARSE_ERR_CODE_MISSING_ITEM=10
#   export BASH_OPTPARSE_ERR_CODE_PARSING_FAILED=10

. bash_optparse << EOF

# Some general notes:
#   *) Each input line is parsed and divided in words, using whitespace as delimiter, just
#      like bash does.
#   *) Use quoting (like "in this example") or escape with a backslash (like in\ this\ example)
#      to insert whitespace in a word, again just like bash (but single-quote doesn't work, and
#      quoting cannot span multiple lines).
#   *) There is a global special keyword: NONE (case insensitive). It is only recognized when
#      unquoted. It is actually a placeholder for an empty word, i.e. it is equivalent to "".
#      In some cases, it is also a valid keyword within quotes, see below.
#   *) Parsing goes on in blocks, delimited by XYZ_BEGIN and XYZ_END, where XYZ is the name
#      of the block. It is safer to follow the order of blocks presented here (SETTINGS,
#      DESCRIPTION, VERSION, OPTIONS, ARGUMENTS), even if it is not strict. All blocks are
#      optional. Indentation inside blocks is not required, but helps readability.
#   *) All keywords (NONE, INT, FLOAT, STRING, INF, VARARGS, TRUE, FALSE, settings names and
#      block_delimiters) are case-insensitive (but using all-uppercase avoids confusion most of
#      the times).
#   *) Lines can be continued by terminating them with a backslash. Comments can be continued in
#      this way, as well.

                             The syntax is 'major.minor'.
  WRAP_WIDTH 80            # This controls the width of the auto-generated help screen. \
                             The default is 80. The minimum is 30.
  AUTO_SHORT_OPTS TRUE     # This controls whether short options are auto-generated or not. \
                             The default is TRUE. Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE.
  ONE_DASH_LONG_OPTS FALSE # This controls whether long options are allowed to be passed \
                             with a single dash (e.g. -version) rather than strictly two. \
                             The default is FALSE. Allowed values are TRUE and FALSE.

  ERR_CODE_OPT_INVALID 2   # This controls the exit/return code in case an invalid option is passed in \
                             the command line. The default is 2.
  ERR_CODE_OPT_TYPE 2      # Same as above, for when an argument of the wrong type is passed (e.g. if you \
                             pass a string as argument to an option expecting an int). The default is 2.
  ERR_CODE_OPT_RANGE 2     # Same as above, for when an option argument is out of range. The default is 2.
  ERR_CODE_ARG_NUM 2       # Same as above, for when the wrong number of arguments is passed (too few or \
                             too many). The default is 2.

DESCRIPTION_BEGIN

# This block is used to provide the description of the script which is printed
# in the auto-generated usage screen (invoked by option --help).
# Describe the purpose of the script and of its arguments here.

  This is just an example script. It takes some options,
  a mandatory argument and some optional ones.

# Notes about DESCRIPTION block:
#   *) These lines will be wrapped together in a single block.
#   *) All whitespace will be substituded by a single space if you
#      don't use quoting.
#   *) The keyword NONE must be quoted, or it will disappear!
#   *) So you'd better quote each line to be safe, after all.

# Notes about OPTION lines:
#   *) The variable name is also used as the long option name (short if it has
#      a single character, see below), but underscores are replaced by dashes
#      (e.g. the variable flag_option is controlled by the option --flag-option).
#      Only alphanumeric character and underscores are allowed in names. The first
#      character must be a letter.
#   *) Apart from 'help' and 'version', there are other reserved names which cannot
#      be used as variable names:
#      +) names starting with 'default_'
#      +) all-uppercase names starting with 'BASH_OPTPARSE_'
#   *) Optionally, a short option name can be specified at the end of the name,
#      after a comma (see float_option_3 for an example). Only alphanumeric
#      characters are allowed, except for the special character '-' which forces
#      the option to be only long (see flag_option for an example, and see below
#      for an explanation about auto-generation of short options).
#   *) If the short_opt name is unspecified and the variable name has a single
#      character, it will be used as a short name (see the option F for an example).
#      To get the long version as well, you would use something like 'F,F'.
#      If the short_opt name is unspecified (and the long name has more than
#      one character, and the AUTO_SHORT_OPT setting is TRUE), bash_optparse
#      will try to generate one from the long option name; but it won't produce
#      any errors if it doesn't succeed.
#   *) There are 4 argument types: STRING, INT, FLOAT and NONE. The first
#      three can have argument ranges and default values. INT and FLOAT types
#      are also subject to type-checking. The floating point representation
#      considered to be valid is that used by C (decimal values only).
#      An optional '+' can be appended to STRING, INT and FLOAT to allow
#      the option to be given more than once and have multiple values (see below).
#   *) STRING arg_ranges are either NONE (or empty) or python regexp's which
#      cover the whole string.
#   *) Numerical (INT and FLOAT) arg_ranges are either NONE (or empty) or
#      intervals expressed in one of the two forms:
#      +) [min:max]
#      +) [min:step:max]
#      If 'step' is positive it starts from min, if negative
#      it starts from max. It can be NONE, but it can't be 0.
#      'min' can be -INF, NONE, or be omitted.
#      'max' can be INF, NONE, or be omitted.
#      Brackets can be omitted (but only both at once, not just one).
#      If a bracket is reversed, or a parenthesis is used instead,
#      the corresponding extreme is not considered to be part of
#      the interval (as in conventional mathematical notation, except
#      that INF is always out of the interval).
#   *) Default values must always be within the given arg_range, with the only
#      exception of unset default values where allowed (see below).
#   *) Numerical options and STRING+ options allow an empty default value
#      (use "" or NONE), to be intended as "unset" (see int_option_1 or float_option_2
#      for an example).
#      In such case, arg_range will only be checked when the corresponding option
#      is actually passed in the command line.
#      The function 'check_is_set' can be used to determine whether the option
#      is unset after parsing (see the code at the end of this file).
#   *) Flags options (those with arg_type NONE or empty) declare variables which
#      are (normally) set to "false" by default, and become "true" when the option is
#      used (note that the value is lowercase).
#   *) It is possible to invert the default value of flags by writing TRUE in
#      the 'default value' field (see option 'F' for an example). If this field is set
#      to NONE or FALSE or is left empty, the default will be "false", as stated above.
#   *) It is possible to declare an extra 'alternate' flag to revert the effect
#      of a flag and force back the default value. In this way, if both flags are passed
#      on the command line, the last one prevails.
#      The alternate flags are declared by appending the alternate name right after the
#      variable name, after a '|' (see option 'go' for an example: its alternate version
#      is 'dont-go' with short form 'n').
#      Alternate options declarations follow almost the same rules as normal options
#      (including the declaration/auto-generation/inhibition of corresponding short options),
#      with some minor differences:
#      +) no variable names are associated to them; therefore, you can use reserved variable
#         names, like e.g. 'default_var' (not reserved option names like 'help', though)
#      +) you can use both underscores and dashes in the long names; underscores will be
#         still be converted to dashes
#      There's no need to provide a description for alternate options: it will be
#      auto-generated.
#   *) Normally, option values are stored in simple bash variables; when an option is
#      passed more than once on the command line, the variable get overwritten and thus
#      only the last value is retained. This behaviour can be changed by appending a '+' to
#      STRING, INT and FLOAT type specifications (see options multi_string, multi_int and
#      multi_float for examples).
#      In that case, the value to the option will be stored in a bash array. If a
#      default argument is provided, it is only assigned if the option is not passed
#      to the command line, and it will be stored in the first element of the array
#      (note: in bash arrays, the first element has index 0).
#      This introduces another (subtle) difference between STRING and STRING+ variables:
#      STRING variables whose default value is NONE are actually initalized to the empty
#      string (and therefore the empty string must be allowed in the arg_range), while
#      STRING+ variables whose default value is NONE are truly uninitialized (and their
#      arg_range can possibly not include the empty string).
